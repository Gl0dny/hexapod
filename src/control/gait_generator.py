        ]
        for positions in step_positions:
            await self.hexapod.move_all_legs(positions)

    async def turn_left(self):
        # Define positions for turning left

    # Additional gait methods can be added here

# workspace Use #sym:get_moving_state to implement motor control queue. The specific moves that hexapod would perform should be tasks for this queue and they shoould be finished before getting to next one ( all servos should reach their positions ). I want an interface ( maybe decorators ) to be able to define specific methods as movement tasks ( being movement task means blocking the robot from performing different movement task ).

#     In this approach:

# The Hexapod class uses an asyncio.Queue to queue movement tasks without blocking.
# The movement_task decorator ensures that movement methods are added to the queue and executed asynchronously.
# The _process_movement_queue method processes tasks and waits non-blockingly using await asyncio.sleep(0.1).
# The GaitGenerator class defines gait patterns using asynchronous methods that utilize move_leg and move_all_legs.
# Ensure that the MaestroUART.get_moving_state method in maestro_uart.py is compatible with asynchronous execution. You may need to modify it to use asynchronous I/O if it's performing blocking operations.

# By adopting this non-blocking approach, you can efficiently control the hexapod's movements and create complex gaits without hindering the robot's ability to perform other tasks.
