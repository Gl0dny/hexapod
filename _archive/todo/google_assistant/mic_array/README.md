Google released [Google Assistant Library](https://github.com/googlesamples/assistant-sdk-python/tree/master/google-assistant-library) for Raspberry Pi to provide hotword detection ("Ok Google" or "Hey Google"), audio recording, assistant response playback and etc. We can add LED lights indicator based on the library to make a device very similar with Google Home.

2. Run `python google_assistant_for_raspberry_pi.py`
